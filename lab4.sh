# The purpose of the lab are to learn:
# In Lab 3, we have learnt:
# * implementing loops
# * reading from standard input
# * checking input parameters
# * checking condition
# In Lab 4, we will learn:
# * function definition and calling
# * nested loops
# * reading from files
# * doing simple calculation
# * use advance feature of shell script programming
